# Event-Guest-List-Manager


# Guest List Manager

A simple and interactive web application for managing a guest list. Users can add guests by name, mark their attendance status, and remove them from the list. The app also timestamps when guests are added.

---

## Features

- Add guest names through an input form.
- Display a list of guests with options to:
  - Mark attendance status (`Attend` / `Not Attend`).
  - Remove guests from the list.
- Show the time each guest was added.
- Guest names longer than 20 characters are truncated with an ellipsis (`....`).
- Alerts the user if the guest count exceeds 10.

---

## Technology Stack

- **HTML**: Structure and layout of the guest list manager.
- **CSS** (via `style.css`): Styling and UI design (linked externally).
- **JavaScript** (via `index.js`): Handles user interactions, DOM manipulation, and dynamic guest management.

---

## File Structure

```

/guest-list-manager
‚îÇ
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html       # Main HTML page
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ style.css        # CSS styles
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ index.js         # JavaScript logic for guest management

```

---

## Usage Instructions

1. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser.
2. Type a guest‚Äôs name into the input field.
3. Click **Add** or press Enter to add the guest to the list.
4. Use the **Attend** button to toggle attendance status.
5. Use the **Remove** button to delete a guest from the list.
6. Be mindful that adding more than 10 guests triggers an alert.

---

## How It Works (Summary)

- The form submission is handled via JavaScript to prevent page reload.
- New guests are added dynamically to the guest list (`<ul>`).
- Each guest entry shows their name (truncated if needed) and the time they were added.
- Buttons for marking attendance and removal are created dynamically for each guest.

---

## Future Enhancements

- Persist guest list data between page reloads using `localStorage`.
- Add validation to prevent duplicate guest names.
- Improve UI responsiveness for mobile devices.
- Include sorting or filtering options for guests.

# Guest List Manager - JavaScript Functionality

This JavaScript file powers a **Guest List Manager** application that allows users to add, track, and manage guest names with timestamp, attendance toggling, and removal functionality.

---

## Features

- ‚úÖ Add a guest with a name input.
- ‚è∞ Display the time the guest was added.
- ‚úÇÔ∏è Truncate names longer than 20 characters and append ellipsis (`....`).
- üîÑ Toggle attendance status (between `Attend` and `Not Attend`).
- ‚ùå Remove a guest from the list.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Alert the user if more than 10 guests are added.

---

## How It Works

### DOM Elements Accessed

- `#guest-form`: The form where users type and submit guest names.
- `#guest-input`: Text input where users type a guest name.
- `#add-guest`: The button to submit the guest.
- `#guest-list`: The container (`<ul>`) where all guest entries appear.

### Main Logic Flow

1. **Form Submission:**
   - Prevents the default form behavior.
   - Trims the entered guest name.

2. **Guest Name Handling:**
   - If the name is longer than 20 characters, it is truncated and appended with `'....'`.
   - A new `<li>` element is created and appended to the guest list.

3. **Timestamp Generation:**
   - Captures the current time using `toLocaleTimeString()` and displays it next to the guest's name.

4. **Buttons Created Per Guest:**
   - **Attend Button**:
     - Toggles between `Attend` and `Not Attend`.
   - **Remove Button**:
     - Deletes the respective `<li>` from the guest list.

5. **Guest Limit Check:**
   - If the guest count exceeds 10, the user is alerted.

6. **Cleanup:**
   - Resets the input field after adding a guest.

## Code Snippet Example

```js
const guestName = guestInput.value.trim();
if (guestName.length > 20) {
    li.textContent = guestName.slice(0, 20) + '....';
} else {
    li.textContent = guestName;
}

Requirements
Browser: Any modern browser supporting vanilla JavaScript

No external libraries required

Potential Improvements
Store guest data using localStorage or sessionStorage.

Add a confirmation dialog before deleting a guest.

Highlight attending guests visually.

Prevent duplicate guest entries.
